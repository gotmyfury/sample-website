<pre class="handwrittenBody2" style="color: rgb(0,200,0); display: inline;">Creeper</pre> was deployed in a network of universities in US. It displays in the infected computer this message; “I’M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!”. This malware moves through the system, computer to computer. Although all of that, this malware was made for testing and isn’t harmful at all.

A program called <pre class="handwrittenBody2" style="color: rgb(255,0,0); display: inline;">Reaper</pre> was then made to capture the Creeper. This holds as a revolutionary prediction about viruses and anti-viruses.

Mytob and Zotob are one of the first viruses with various functionality, especially the functionalities of <pre class="handwrittenBody2" style="color: rgb(204,0,204); display: inline;">worms, backdoors, and botnets</pre>.

Mytob exploits security's vulnerability and use remote code execution. It then propagates to other network via victim's address book. One of its job is to redirect URIs to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) to prevent updates of the computer, remaining with the current anti-virus software and its vulnerability.

Zotob is a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Plug and Play for Windows 2000. Zotob then searches for other software vulnerability to propagate itself.
